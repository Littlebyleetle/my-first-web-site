<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p STYLE="Margin-top:30px;">
We the people fight for our existence<br>
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free<br>
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance<br>
Fading like the stars we wish to be<br>
You know I didn't mean what I just said<br>
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed<br>
And it just don't matter now<br>
Cos little by little<br>
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of<br>
Little by little<br>
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off<br>
Little by little<br>
You have to give it all in all your life<br>
And all the time I just ask myself why<br>
You're really here<br>
True perfection has to be imperfect<br>
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true<br>
The day has come and now you'll have to accept<br>
The life inside your head we give to you<br>
You know I didn't mean what I just said<br>
But my God woke up on the wrong side of his bed<br>
And it just don't matter now<br>
Cos little by little<br>
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of<br>
Little by little<br>
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off<br>
Little by little<br>
You have to give it all in all your life<br>
And all the time I just ask myself why<br>
You're really here<br>
Hey Little by little<br>
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of<br>
Little by little<br>
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off<br>
Little by little<br>
You had to give it all in all your life<br>
And all the time I just ask myself why<br>
You're really here<br>
Why am I really here?<br>
Why am I really here?<br>
