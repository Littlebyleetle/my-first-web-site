<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p STYLE="Margin-top:30px;">
  I’m Standing on a bridge<br>
  I’m waiting in the dark<br>
  I thought that you’d be here by now<br>
  Theres nothing but the rain<br>
  No footsteps on the ground<br>
  I’m listening but theres no sound<br>
  Isn’t anyone tryin to find me?<br>
  Won't somebody come take me home<br>
  It’s a damn cold night<br>
  Its Trying to figure out this life<br>
  Wont you take me by the hand take me somewhere new<br>
  I dont know who you are<br>
  but I’m, I’m with you<br>
  im looking for a place<br>
  searching for a face<br>
  is there anybody here i know<br>
  cause nothings going right<br>
  and no one likes to be alone<br>
  Isn’t anyone tryin to find me?<br>
  Won't somebody come take me home<br>
  It’s a damn cold night<br>
  oh why is everything so confusing<br>
  maybe I’m just out of my mind<br>
  yea yea yea<br>
  It’s a damn cold night<br>
  Trying to figure out this life<br>
  Wont you take me by the hand take me somewhere new<br>
  I dont know who you are<br>
  but I’m, I’m with you<br>
  take me by the hand take me somewhere new<br>
  I dont know who you are<br>
  but I’m, I’m with you<br>
  take me by the hand take me somewhere new<br>
  I dont know who you are<br>
  but I’m, I’m with you<br>
