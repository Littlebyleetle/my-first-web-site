<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p STYLE="Margin-top:30px;">
Please dont see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies<br>
Please see me reaching out for someone I cant see<br>
Take my hand lets see where we wake up tomorrow<br>
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand<br>
Id be damned Cupids demanding back his arrow<br>
So lets get drunk on our tears and<br>
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young<br>
Its hunting season and the lambs are on the run<br>
Searching for meaning<br>
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?<br>
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?<br>
Woe is me. if were not careful turns into reality<br>
Dont you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow<br>
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer<br>
Turn the page maybe well find a brand new ending<br>
Where were dancing in our tears and<br>
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young<br>
Its hunting season and the lambs are on the run<br>
Searching for meaning<br>
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?<br>
I thought I saw you out there crying<br>
I thought I heard you call my name<br>
I thought I heard you out there crying<br>
Just the same<br>
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young<br>
Its hunting season and this lamb is on the run<br>
Searching for meaning<br>
I thought I saw you out there crying<br>
I thought I heard you call my name<br>
I thought I heard you out there crying<br>
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?<br>
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?<br>
